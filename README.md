# Digit-Recognizer
•Implemented a CNN model to recognise and predict labels for a given image of a handwritten digit using the MNIST dataset
•Achieved an accuracy of 99.17% on a Test set of 10,000 images. Model trained on a Training set of 60,000 images of 28x28 resolution
•Trained the model on a dataset provided by a Kaggle competition.Submission of predicted labels yielded an accuracy score of 98.935%
•Developed a GUI using Tkinter to allow the user to draw digits which act as input to the model and display the predicted label
